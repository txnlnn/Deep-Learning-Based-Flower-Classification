# Deep-Learning-Based-Flower-Classification
Group Project


# Project Overview
This project uses Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) to classify different types of flowers from images. It tackles common challenges in computer vision, such as lighting variations, background inconsistencies, and multiple angles of view.
